# 🧠 Vigor – A Best-Practice Mobile Workout Planning App for Software Requirements Engineering (2024)

--- 

**Vigor** is a mobile **workout planning app** developed as a best-practice project for the **Software Requirements Engineering** course in 2024. It demonstrates the complete software requirements lifecycle — from initial elicitation to user interface design — along with a functional mobile front-end that includes authentication.This project emphasizes a comprehensive understanding and application of the entire software requirements lifecycle, including elicitation, analysis, modeling, documentation, and prototyping.

## 🏋️ What is Vigor?

Vigor helps users **plan, track, and manage their workout routines**. The app simulates the structure of a real workout application with features such as:

- User registration and login
- Workout categories and planning UI (mockups)
- Personalization elements
- Clean and intuitive user interface


 
While the backend was not implemented, the front-end mimics a working product and showcases the flow of a professional app prototype.
